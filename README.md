This repository demonstrates a common error involving unsafe code and mutable references in Rust when dealing with vectors. The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe and corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of safe Rust practices and the potential dangers of using raw pointers without careful consideration.
